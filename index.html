        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            A passion project I built to help immigrants quickly access the
            resources, rights, and emergency guidance they may need, all in one
            place, and without the overwhelm and confusion. It started as a
            simple question: what if the critical information people desperately
            need in stressful moments wasn't buried under ten tabs and legal
            jargon and spread across different websites?
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed RISE to be clean, multilingual, easy-to-navigate,
            centralized tool. The "Know Your Rights" card is built to be
            understood at a glance and usable in real situations. RISE is part
            practical guide, part safety net, and one of the things I'm most
            proud of building. (WIP)
